          This is a very important item needed to get our result. The pounder is
          a wooden contianer where yams and any other poundable content are
          place for proper merching/poundering till the content in it finally
          becomes what we want them to be, into other words the wooden pounder
          is an accient item basically used for making a pounded yam which the
          African also call (iyan) the end product and ready to be served as our
          meal

        <li><strong>Blender</strong></li>

        <p>
          The Blender serves as an alternative method. Likes it was explained,
          this is an advanced method of getting our result (pounded yam)
          technologically without having to go through the stress of effortless
          pounding. it also saved us engery and consume lesser time.
